# Claude Code

Claude Code, the agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands.

## Memory

Memory in Claude refers to a way of storing and reusing contextual information across interactions so the model can recall important details about a user, project, or task. By default, Claude doesn’t retain information between sessions for privacy and safety reasons. However, when building tools or applications—especially ones that involve code generation, task tracking, or user preferences—having a persistent memory helps maintain continuity. It allows the assistant to respond more accurately and consistently without needing to be reminded of the same information repeatedly. The memory file acts as a structured way to give Claude this long-term context, enabling more intelligent, personalized, and efficient interactions.

To setup project memory

```bash
> /init
```

Create a personal preference (applicable on all projects) on: 

```bash
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```


Claude Code provides two options for resuming previous conversations:

- continue to automatically continue the most recent conversation
- resume to display a conversation picker


## Execution task list

Run claude code using the plan files

[create-prd.mdc](./plan/create-prd.mdc)
[generate-tasks.mdc](./plan/generate-tasks.mdc)
[process-task-list.mdc](./plan/process-task-list.mdc)


Start claude and first explain your project including create-prd 

```
I would like to generate an excel report for bank customers which includes their daily activity @plan/create-prd.mdc
```

The console will ask you number of questions to clarify the project even further. Once all answered, proceed with task generation

```
@plan/generate-tasks.mdc please genereate tasks for @tasks/prd-bank-customer-daily-activity-report.md
```

Once its generated you can proceed with executing the tasks

```
@plan/process-task-list.mdc lets start @tasks/tasks-prd-bank-customer-daily-activity-report.md
```

This will go through each and every task, and complete them 1 by 1. Eventually you will have all code generated by claude-code.

## MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources.


```bash

# Basic syntax
claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

# Example: Adding a local server
claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2

```

You can also place an .mcp.json file 

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse",
        "51328",
        "--debug"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
