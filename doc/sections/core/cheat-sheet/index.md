# Roadmap for a Generative AI Engineer

## 1. **Foundations of Generative AI**

* **Transformer Architecture**
Transformers are the foundational architecture behind many powerful AI models like GPT, BERT, and others. They revolutionized NLP by enabling models to understand context better than previous methods like RNNs or CNNs.

* **Attention Mechanism**
Imagine you’re reading a sentence and want to understand the meaning of a particular word. You don’t just look at that word alone — you also glance at other related words to get context. Attention works the same way in AI models. It allows the model to capture relationships across words, no matter how far apart they are.

* **Tokenization**
Tokenization is the process of converting raw text into smaller pieces called tokens — which are the units that models can understand and process. A token can be: A word ("apple") A subword ("un", "happy") A single character ("a", "?") Even whitespace or punctuation (" ", "."). Tokens are specific to the LLM and its tokenizer. For OpenAI, [Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

* **Language Modeling Basics**
Language modeling refers to how models learn to understand and generate text. There are two main types of language models that are important to understand: causal language models and masked language models. Causal language models, also known as autoregressive models, are trained to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. This means they generate text left to right, one token at a time, without access to future words during training. An example would be: given the input “The cat sat on the”, the model learns to predict the next word, such as “mat”. These models are primarily used for generation tasks, such as chatbots, text completion, summarization, and code generation. Popular causal models include GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA. Masked language models are trained differently. Instead of predicting the next token, they learn to fill in missing words within a sentence. These models are bidirectional, meaning they can use both the left and right context to make predictions. For example, given the input “The cat sat on the [MASK]”, the model is trained to predict the masked word “mat”. Masked models are generally better suited for understanding tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and semantic similarity. BERT and RoBERTa are examples of this type.

* **Embeddings**
Embeddings are vector representations of data like words, sentences, documents, or images. They capture the meaning or features of the input in a way that allows similar items to be close together in a numerical space. For example, similar words or sentences have similar embeddings. In language models, embeddings help the model understand and compare meanings. Word embeddings represent individual words, while sentence and document embeddings represent larger text. Image embeddings do the same for visual data. These embeddings are used in tasks like semantic search, clustering, recommendation, and linking user input with relevant information.


## 2. **Using & Customizing Pretrained Models**

* **Prompt Engineering**
Crafting effective prompts to get desired outputs from large pretrained models (LLMs) via APIs or local inference.

* **Fine-tuning**
Fine-tuning means taking a pre-trained language model and training it further on your own specific data to make it perform better on your tasks or domain. Instead of building a model from scratch, you adapt the existing model to understand your industry language, style, or problem better. This helps improve accuracy in tasks like classification, summarization, or question answering. You can fine-tune all model parameters, which is resource-intensive, or use parameter-efficient methods that train only a small part of the model, saving time and cost. Fine-tuning is a key way to customize general models for practical, domain-specific use.

* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning refers to methods that adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks by updating only a small part of the model instead of all its parameters. This makes fine-tuning faster, cheaper, and requires less computing power. Techniques like LoRA, Adapters, and Prompt Tuning insert small trainable modules or modify prompts while keeping the main model mostly frozen. This approach allows you to customize a model efficiently for your specific needs without needing huge amounts of data or expensive hardware.

* **Few-shot, One-shot, Zero-shot Learning**
These are ways to use pretrained models to perform tasks with little or no additional training. Zero-shot means the model can handle a task without seeing any examples beforehand, relying purely on its general knowledge. One-shot and few-shot learning provide the model with just one or a few examples in the prompt to guide it. This lets you get good results quickly without needing to fine-tune the model on large datasets, making it very useful for new or rare tasks.


## 3. **Data Preparation and Management**

* **Data Collection & Cleaning**
This involves gathering relevant and high-quality data that matches your task or domain. Once collected, the data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed—removing errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies—to ensure the model learns from accurate and useful information. Good data preparation is essential for effective fine-tuning or building reliable retrieval systems.

* **Data Augmentation Techniques**
Data augmentation means creating more or varied training examples from your existing data to help the model learn better. This can include techniques like paraphrasing text, adding noise, translating sentences, or mixing data sources. The goal is to increase the diversity and size of your dataset without collecting new data, which can improve model accuracy and robustness.


## 4. **Retrieval & Knowledge Integration**

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) means combining a pretrained language model with an external knowledge base or documents. Instead of relying only on what the model “knows,” it searches for relevant information from outside sources and uses that to generate more accurate and up-to-date answers.

* **Semantic Search & Vector Similarity**
Semantic Search & Vector Similarity involves finding documents or data that are most relevant to a user’s query by comparing the closeness of their embeddings in a vector space. This helps locate the best matches even if exact keywords don’t appear.

* **Vector Databases & Indexing**
Vector Databases & Indexing are specialized tools like FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate that efficiently store, organize, and search large collections of embeddings. They make semantic search fast and scalable for real-world applications.

* **Knowledge Graph Basics**
Knowledge Graph Basics is an optional concept where structured symbolic information about entities and their relationships is used alongside language models. Knowledge graphs can help improve reasoning, factual accuracy, and provide more explicit knowledge than text embeddings alone.


## 5. **Multi-modal AI**

* **Multi-modal Models**
Multi-modal models combine different types of data—like text, images, audio, or video—into a single system that can understand and generate across these formats. This allows AI to handle more complex tasks, such as describing images, answering questions about videos, or creating content that mixes text and visuals.

* **Embedding & Prompting Strategies for Multi-modal Inputs**
Embedding & Prompting Strategies for Multi-modal Inputs involve converting different data types into compatible vector representations and designing prompts that guide the model to process and relate multiple modalities effectively. This helps the model make sense of combined inputs and generate meaningful outputs that involve several forms of data.


## 6. **Evaluation & Explainability**

* **Evaluation Metrics**
Evaluation metrics help measure how well a model performs on tasks like language generation or classification. Perplexity indicates how well a language model predicts text; lower values mean better predictions. BLEU and ROUGE measure how close generated text is to reference texts, useful in translation or summarization. F1 and Accuracy evaluate classification tasks by balancing precision and recall or measuring correct predictions. Understanding these helps you choose and improve models effectively.

* **Explainability & Interpretability**
Explainability and interpretability involve simple methods to help stakeholders understand why a model made certain predictions or outputs. This might include highlighting important input features, showing attention weights, or providing example-based explanations. Clear explanations build trust and help diagnose model errors or biases.
